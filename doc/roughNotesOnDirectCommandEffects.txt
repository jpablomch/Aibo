Aibo Commands

Walk

f 0.1 - About 2 seconds, no buffer issue
f 0.2 - About 4 seconds, no buffer issue
f 0.3 - About 4 seconds, no buffer issue
f 0.4 - About 4 seconds, no buffer issue
f 0.5 - About 4 seconds, no buffer issue
f 0.6 - About 4 seconds, no buffer issue
f 0.7 - About 4 seconds, no buffer issue
f 0.8 - About 4 seconds, no buffer issue
f 0.9 - About 5 seoncds, no buffer issue
f 1 - Hesitation in moving in the beg.  did not move as far

Note: < 1 seems Ideal movement.  Need to take measurements for distance moved in 0.1 to 0.9

f -0.1 - No movement just jittery, no buffer issue
f -0.2 - Movement like negative rotate about 3 seconds, [anomoly]
f -0.3 - Movement back about 3 seconds, no buffer issue
f -0.4 - Movement back about 3 seconds, no buffer issue
f -0.5 - Movement back about 3 seconds, seemed faster than before, no buffer issue
f -0.6 - Movement back about 4 seconds, a little faster, no buffer
f -0.7 - Movement back about 5 seconds, no buffer
f -0.8 - Movement back about 5 seconds, no buffer
f -0.9 - Movement back about 5 seconds, no buffer
f -1.0 - Movement back about 5 seconds, no buffer

Note:  Seems like a strong correlation between amount and speed of motors
and there is actually a defined time interval

Best/Smoothest movements between 0.2 & 0.8 values
< 0.2 is no movement and > 0.8 is rough

Rotate
Positive - Counterclockwise
r 0.1 - About 4 seconds, actual movement counter clockwise +pi direction
r 0.2 - About 4 seconds, almost pi/4 radians
r 0.3 - About 4 seconds, similar amount
r 0.4 - About 4 seconds, almost pi/2 radians
r 0.5 - No movement! Dropped???
			- Again, about 4 seconds, almost pi/2 radians
			- Again, about 4 seconds, almost pi/2 radians
r 0.6 - No movement!
			- Again, 4 secs, slightly more than pi/2 radians
r 0.7 - Time constant, almost 3/4pi
r 0.8 - Almost 3/4pi
r 0.9 - roughly 3/4 pi
r 1 - Slightly more than 3/4 pi

Negative - Clockwise
r -0.1 - nothing
			 - again, about pi/8 radians
r -0.2 - slightly more than pi/8 radians
r -0.3 - About pi/4
r -0.4 - Slightly less than pi/4
r -0.5 - Almost pi/2
r -0.6 - Slightly more than pi/2
r -0.7 - Slightly less than 3pi/4
r -0.8 - Slightly less than 3pi/4
r -0.9 - Slightly less than pi

Interweave f/r commands
f 0.5, r 0.3 - Seems right, Buffer check: f0 resulted in repeat or r0.3?
	- f0 again seems like repeat of r0.3
	- f0 again
	- f0 again
	- f0 again
	- f0 again
	- f0 again
	- f0 again
	- try r0 to clear it - no response from aibo
	- f0 now does nothing as it should

f 0.5, r 0.3, r 0 - straight ok, turn ok, straight again!
	- r0 straight ahead like f0.5
	- r0 straight ahead like f0.5
	- r0 straight ahead like f0.5
	- try f0 to clear it out - no response from aibo
	- r0 - no response

f 0.5, f 0, r 0.3, r 0 - seems right, buffer check: f0 nothing!
	- buffer check again: r0 nothing!
 
Note: Seems as though we need to send a [command]0 after whatever we send it to get it follow subsequent commands correctly.
Sending f0 or r0 stops it in it's tracks immediately.


Pan:
Each number -1 ... 1 correlates to a position between 180 - 0
Entering a command will move the head to that exact location
0 is home

Tilt:
Same thing but from 0 to -1
0 is home
